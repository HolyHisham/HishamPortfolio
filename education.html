            <h4>University Logo:</h4>
            <p>
              The University Logo symbolizes the importance of science, the
              infinite human desire for knowledge and the importance of the role
              of Damascusin the development of science and scientists. The
              purple color symbolizes the Damascene berry (Tout Shami), which is
              a kind of fruit that is only found in Damascus. Hence, it was
              chosen to be the distinctive color of the university to express
              its uniqueness. It is worth mentioning that this color is the
              color approved for the signature of the UniversityPresident, a
              property not enjoyed by any other university president in the
              world. As for the lamp, it symbolizes knowledge in different
              cultures and radiates the light of science and knowledge. The logo
              is crowned with a Qur'anic verse which says: "Say, oh my lord,
              advance me in knowledge.", which is the true message of the
              University of Damascus, and its goal which will never cease to be
              pursued.

            <h4>History of Damascus University:</h4>
            <p>
              DamascusUniversity is the oldest and the most important university
              among the other five public Syrian universities. It is thought of
              as the mother university which was established around the
              beginning of the twentieth century. Neither hesitant nor timid, it
              has raised the banner of knowledge, science and thought for over
              nine decades and has been keen on enlightening Arab generations
              and foreign students. Damascus University, lofty and towering as
              it is now, had taken careful and deliberate steps in the
              beginning, then pace accelerated and the universityhas expanded
              and become more advanced. The history of any university and that
              of its homeland are inseparable, for the events and developments
              in Syria have had a great impact on that history. Hence, modern
              history has left its marks on Damascus University. Therefore, it
              is important to have a brief account of the history of this lofty
              academic edifice summarized as follows: In 1901, the School of
              Medicine was founded in Damascus. This nucleus of Damascus
              University was opened in 1903 andconsisted of the faculties of
              Medicine and Pharmacy. The Turkish language was the language of
              instruction. In 1913, the school of Law was opened in Beirut. Most
              of the instructors were Arabs and they used Arabicas the language
              of instruction. The school was moved to Damascus in 1914 and
              returned to Beirut in 1915. The School of Law returned to Beirut
              once more by the end of the World War I. In 1919, the Medical
              Institute and the School of Law were founded on January 1stand
              September 2ndrespectively. In 1923, the School of Law was renamed
              the Institute of Law. Also, the Institute of Law and that of
              Medicine, the Arab Academy and the House of Antiquitywere united
              under the name of the Syrian University. In 1926, the Arab Academy
              and the House of Antiquity became independent of the university.
              In 1928, the HigherLiterary School was founded. Its administration
              was linked to the university and then it was named the Higher
              School of Letters and was closed in 1935/1936. The Era of National
              Independence Soon after the end of the French mandate on Syria and
              with the eviction of the foreign armies, education in Syria
              started improving. More care and attention were given to it, and
              consequently it started growing and flourishing. Hence, all the
              existing educational facilities were given a lot of support and
              new colleges and institutions were founded. Moreover, all
              university laws were radically modified to enable the university
              to receive a growing number of students. New specialties were
              created in an attempt to catch up with the global development in
              science and education. As of 1946, the faculties in the university
              did not remain limited to the medical and law institutes, but
              higher colleges and institutes in new specializations were created
              so that it would be possible to catch up with scientific and
              cultural progress in the world.Since then and until 1958, the year
              of the unity between Syria and Egypt and the establishment of the
              United Arab Republic, the institutions of higher education became
              as follows: The Institute of Medicine, the Institute of Law,
              Faculty of Science, Faculty of Arts, Higher Institute for
              Teachers, Faculty of Engineering in Aleppo, Faculty of Sharia and
              the Institute of Business. In 1958, a new law was issued to
              organize universities in the Northern and Southern regions of the
              United Arab Republic, under which the "Syrian University" was
              renamed "Damascus University" and,consequently, a second
              university was established in the Northern Region under the name
              of "Aleppo University". In 1959, a list of regulatory executive
              rules was issued. Thus, Damascus University included the following
              faculties: Faculty of Letters, Faculty of Law, Faculty of
              Commerce, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of
              Dentistry, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Education and
              Faculty of Sharia. Damascus University was also authorized to
              award postgraduate degrees. During the period Syria was part of
              the United Arab Republic, the number of university students and
              faculty members increased; cooperation between universities in the
              two regions grew, and there was an active exchange of professors
              and students. After the dissolution of the unity in 1961, there
              was no noticeable development in the university, except in the
              university regulations which were adjusted to suit the situation
              in the country. This situation continued until the outbreak of the
              8thof March Revolution. Only then, education flourished and
              prospered unprecedentedly, particularly following the Corrective
              Movement in 1970. This was due to the fact that the late
              president,Hafiz al-Assad, leader of the Corrective Movement, gave
              special attention to all sectors of higher education hoping they
              would playa great role in building a greater future for our
              nation. Damascus University was very fortunate to receive all this
              support for the existing faculties. New departments were
              established; other specialties were continued; intermediate
              institutes attached to faculties were founded and all these
              institutions were provided with up-to-date laboratories and
              equipment. By then, Damascus University comprised: Faculty of Arts
              and Human Sciences, Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Education,
              Faculty of Law, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Sharia, Faculty
              of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of
              Science, Faculty of Fine Arts, faculty of Civil Engineering,
              Faculty of Architecture, Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical
              Engineering and the Higher Institute of Administrative
              Development. Most institutes and colleges were housed innew
              buildings, as well. A number of accommodationunits were set up for
              students in the Basselal-Assad university dormitories. A number of
              other units are still under construction, currently. An
              independent building was also constructed for nurses working in
              university hospitals. Graduate studies were given special
              attention throughthe opening of a number of postgraduate diplomas
              in various specializations as well as some qualification diplomas.
              Master's degrees were also offered in most of the specializations
              besides Ph.D. degrees in some of them. In addition, Damascus
              University was committed to the principle of using Arabic as a
              means of instruction in all faculties in order to enhance the Arab
              national role that it promotes. A number of professors were loaned
              or seconded to other universities in the Arab world. Hundreds of
              university books were authored in Arabic by university professors,
              and students were provided with these books to facilitate their
              study and research. This is a quick overview of the history of
              Damascus University. We, at Damascus University, find that though
              our accomplishments were below our ambition, we are still looking
              forward to a brighter and more brilliant future, and to a day in
              which we can be proud of the great achievements of the scientific
              research held within the walls of our university.
